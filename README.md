	I am thrilled to share my recent project on Bank Loan Analysis using power BI. I have also fired SQL query and compared results with the power BI.  Through this project I have gained knowledge of various functionalities of Power BI like Data Cleaning, Data Modelling, Data Processing, Power Query, Date Tables, and various functions like Time Intelligence, DAX, Date, Text, Filter, Calculate, SUM/ SUMX. I also learnt to create KPI’s, Charts and Navigations. In this project I have made 3 dashboards.
